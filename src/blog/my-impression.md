excerpt: My impression of 11ty and its uses

## Initial Impression

This type of generating posts will make it really easy making multiple posts and not having to worry about putting in correct links and so forth. I only need to make a markdown in the blog folder and it will appear as a page on my website. This will also make the whole site have somewhat of a fluency in the whole page when using the same style but having different content in each post.

## Uses

This type of generating websites skips the part of working with a server and compiles it all into a site which in its turn makes it faster to generate. The problem would be if you were to connect some kind of database to this it would be better to use express in that case.
